Intro
=====

Base on this post:http://ddewaele.blogspot.com/2011/05/introducing-google-places-api.html
I create a simple android program to introduce Google API working on android.
This uses:
	android-maven-plugin 3.0.0
	google api client 1.6.0 beta
	
This app is very simple and work with android 2.1 and above (I'm sure it will work with 2.2 and 2.3.3).
It got a button, when you click on the button it will make a request to google and return the result (name of the place) to textview.
I use fix location but you can change it easily in class: PlaceRequest.java

Use
---
To make it work, you should provide you Google Place API key in class PlaceRequest.java
